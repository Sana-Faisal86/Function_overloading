# Function_overloading :

Function overloading is a TypeScript feature that lets us define a function that accepts different kinds of arguments. TypeScript mainly adds data type-checking capabilities that are missing in JavaScript. This makes programming easier since we don't have to check the data type of variables and other values ourselves.
